# Ethereum Smart Contracts, Tokens and Dapps Notes

### Getting started
* ethereum is the world's leading blockchain platform for developing decentralized applications on the blockchain
* ethereum has its own scripting language called Solidity
* Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) - capable of executing logic, algorithms and processing data inputs
* ETH is turing complete, meaning, it is able to run code written by a developer or executed by an end user 
* we can use Solidity for writing smart contracts
* a smart contract is a contract written in code. They are setting up rules in a negotiation between two parties. A smart contract is an object on the ETH blockchain that contains EVM code functions 
* a smart contract can store data, make decisions, interact with other contracts and send data
* ethereum is attempting to improve on earlier generation blockchain platforms
* it separates the blockchain state from the account state and creates a mapping between them

### Ethereum Virtual Machine
* machine that powers the ethereum platform. it executes code
* capable of executing logic, algorithms and processing data inputs
* responsible for running thousands of nodes spread accross the world
* it is managing the state of the blockchain, managing accounts, validating transactions, executing code on the network
* all nodes run the EVM (world computer)

### Smart Contract
* once written, it is compiled in 2 views: assembly (human readable) and bytecode (machine readable)
* compiled code executes on the EVM

### Useful tools
* Etherscan - blockchain explorer
* Metamask - MetaMask equips you with a key vault, secure login, token wallet, and token exchangeâ€”everything you need to manage your digital assets
* Remix - online IDE for createing smart contracts
* web3.js - collection of libraries for interacting with a local or remote ethereum node
* Infura - Gives you access to the Ethereum network without running your own local node
* Ganache - functionality for building and testing your local blockchain
* Truffle - A development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline meant to make your life easier as an Ethereum developer
* Geth - comand line interface for running a full ethereum node
