# Blockchain Notes

### Blockchain
- "shared db that contains a list of transactions (shared between the users in the netword)"
- data is not held by any central authority and it is impossible to manipulate with the data in the chain
- we get a shared permanent history of transactions that we can trust, it is accurate and up to date
- completely new way to share data
- allows us to make transactions that are transparent and more cheap
- example of potential industries suitable for Blockchain: personal identification
- currently, most of our personal IDs are stored somewhere in a centralised DB. There are potential risks for that
- in blockhain, data isn't in a cetralized db. it is shared with everyone and vebrified by the people in the network with the help of cryptography
- data breaches and stealing data is almost impossible
- in the example of supply chain, in traditional cases, data is mostly always not shared between companies and it has a problem with being up to data
- no matter the data is public, it is also anonymous thanks to cryptography


### Concepts
- transaction is a record that contains the data of the sender, the reciever and the amount
- when enough transactions are made to make a block, that block is put on the chain permanently
- every block in the chain has a unique hash - fingerprint, so that we can later identify which data is in the block
- if you change the data in the block, that action will also change the hash, making it invalid
- if the block is changed, a new block will be made and the old one will also stay in the chain
